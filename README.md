This is my final year project for Aberystwyth university.

I have been tasked with developing a website that helps football officials with the completion of match reports and provides them with a means of communication with each other.

The main point of the site is to provide referees with a means of completing match reports online thus removing the need for them to complete a paper version and send it in the post. 

I have used Bootstrap for the front end and PHP and MySQL for the backend. I have also used some jQuery and plain javaScript to alter some of the sites functionality.
